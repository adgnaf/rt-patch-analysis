Subject: [PATCH/RFC -rt] local_bh_enable() is safe for irqs_disabled()

In local_bh_enable() there is a WARN_ON(irqs_disabled()), but looking
at the rest of the code, it seems it expects to be used with
interrupts off, so is this warning really necessary?

I hit this warning in the ads7846 touchscreen driver timer function
where enable_irq() may be called with interrupts disabled.  Since
enable_irq now calls local_bh_disable/enable for IRQ resend, this
warning is triggered.

Patch against 2.6.23.9-rt12
