Subject: patches/rtmutex-rearrange.patch


From: Gregory Haskins <ghaskins@novell.com>

The current logic makes rather coarse adjustments to current->state since
it is planning on sleeping anyway.  We want to eventually move to an
adaptive (e.g. optional sleep) algorithm, so we tighten the scope of the
adjustments to bracket the schedule().  This should yield correct behavior
with or without the adaptive features that are added later in the series.
We add it here as a separate patch for greater review clarity on smaller
changes.
