- Our problem is not the same with FAST'13. A bigger scope than fs.
  - A concise definition of problem sort is needed, or different and more detail whatever.
  - e.g. Does the performance patch a RT relevant performance enhancement, or the whole system, as the 2.6.22-cpuidle_last_measured_004.patch. This leads to the other two problems below.
- Some patches change I find irrelevant with RT features directly. Not all the patches are about preempte, I guess, most of them are not.
  - The problem is do we need to find the connection? Does it a normal patch or something specific in RT? The second question is beyond our discuss currently. 
  - Although I just read few patches, I think it is necessary. Should we isolate preempte things from the other patches we don't yet know the relation with RT? 
  - From some material I read, as it is a system, some changes seem irrelevant with RT do affect RT performance. Do we need to investigate the mechanism？
