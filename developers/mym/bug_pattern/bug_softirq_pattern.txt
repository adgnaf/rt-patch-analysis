PATTERN1：

API替换
-	__raise_softirq_irqoff(NET_RX_SOFTIRQ);
+	raise_softirq_irqoff(NET_RX_SOFTIRQ);


PATCHES:
[[file:2.6.22/preempt-realtime-net-softirq-fixups.patch][2.6.22]]



PATTERN2:

在rt kernel不会在IRQ上下文里面运行softirq，而是在thread context里面运行
softirq

non-RT kernel could deadlock on rt_mutex_trylock() in softirq context. On
-RT we don't run softirqs in IRQ context but in thread context so it is
not a issue here.

PATCHES:
[[file:4.4/rtmutex-trylock-is-okay-on-RT.patch][4.4]]



PATTERN3:
和ksoftirq和ktimersoftirq相关。

This patch moves the TIMER and HRTIMER softirqs out of the `ksoftirqd`
thread into its own `ktimersoftd`. The former can now run SCHED_OTHER
(same as mainline) and the latter at SCHED_FIFO due to the wakeups.
